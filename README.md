# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

The project involves developing a classic X and O game, which includes managing a game board and two players.

Class "Player":
 - Responsible for defining players and their symbols ('X' or 'O').

Class "Board":
 - Represents and updates the game board;
 - Checks for a winner or if the game ends in a draw.

Class "Game":
 - Manages the game flow;
 - Interacts with players to input their moves;
 - Displays the current state of the game board during gameplay.

The game continues in a loop until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.
